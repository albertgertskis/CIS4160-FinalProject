# Introduction 
For this school group project, we were tasked with choosing a website and recreating one major part of the website. 
Since I'm an avid Reddit user, I thought it would be cool to recreate Reddit's website. I thought I could recreate 
all of Reddit in the 3-5 days that I had but only ended up recreating the front page posts and the karma voting system.

The main code you should look at consists of these php/js/sql pages: <br />
1. all_posts.php --> The main page <br />
2. post_voting.js --> How the voting system works (color changes), AJAX calls, etc. <br />
3. vote_direction.js --> How color of upvotes/downvotes is maintained between pages <br />
4. generate_redit_tables.sql --> Knowledge of MySQL + relational database foundations <br />

I just wanted you guys to see this code so you can get a general sense of how I code and what I already know. If there is anything more you would like to see in regards to this project such as screenshots, gifs, etc., feel free to contact me at any time!
