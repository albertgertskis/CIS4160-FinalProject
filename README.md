# Introduction 
For this school group project, we were tasked with choosing a website and recreating one major part of the website. 
Since I'm an avid Reddit user, I thought it would be cool to recreate Reddit's website. I thought I could recreate 
all of Reddit in the 3-5 days that I had but only ended up recreating the front page posts and the karma voting system.
